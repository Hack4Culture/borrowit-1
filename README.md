Uber for borrowing stuffs

## Problem Backround

As Andela scales, It is becoming difficult to preserve our culture. For instance, it is becoming increasingly common for someone to take other people stuffs without duly notifying the owner. Sometimes the owner get their stuff after some hours or days. Sometimes they never get their stuff returned.

## Project Description
This project aims to solve that problem by creating an online platform where an Andelan can request for things/stuffs they need and get timely response from other Andelans. The platform would keep track of borrowed and returned items.

## Technology Stack
